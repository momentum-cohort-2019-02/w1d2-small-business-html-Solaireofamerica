                    <img src="../images/wild-hyacinth.jpg" height="200px" width="auto" alt="Picture of this plant!"/>
                    <p>This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. 
                    The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. It will grow in 
                    lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows 
                    or prairies. Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. 
                    The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered. Bulbs 
                    should be planted in the autumn. Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather 
                    than by runners.</p>

                    <img src="../images/lily-of-the-valley.jpg" height="200px" width="auto" alt="Picture of this plant!"/>
                    <p> With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge 
                    bells that dangle above bright emerald-green leaves -- this nearly deer-proof 
                    shade lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. But the pretty 
                    plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and rapidly, and anyone 
                    who gardens in a small space will want to watch this perennial to make sure it 
                    stays in bounds. Tolerates shade well. Warning: this plant is poisonous.</p>

                    <img src="../images/crown-imperials.jpg" height="200px" width="auto" alt="Picture of this plant!"/>
                    <p>Crown imperials are strong-growing bulbous plants, 
                    making rapid growth in the spring, flowering during April/early May and dying 
                    down in early summer. Best in raised beds or planters. Does not tolerate shade; 
                    needs a warm, sunny position where it can be left undisturbed for many years.</p>

                    <img src="../images/persian-buttercup.jpg" height="200px" width="auto" alt="Picture of this plant!"/>
                    <p>This species of buttercup can get up to 2 feet 
                    tall and has large showy blooms in a variety of colors from May to June. Persian 
                    buttercups are most commonly grown from tubers planted in the beginning of spring. 
                    Each plant will produce up to 70 blooms in a season. Good for cooler weather; 
                    can tolerate light frost.</p>

                    <img src="../images/spring-starflower.jpg" height="200px" width="auto" alt="Picture of this plant!"/>
                    <p>These charming little blooming plants hail from 
                    Argentina and Uruguay and form dense clumps of perennial flowers to chase the 
                    winter doldrums away. These flowers spring from fall planted bulbs. They can 
                    get up to half a foot tall with a similar spread. Each bulb will produce 
                    numerous flowering stems with slender, deeply green foliage. Blooms are 
                    fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white petals.</p>

                    <p>We have a wide variety of tulips in many colors. Plant tulip 
                    bulbs in the fall, 6 to 8 weeks before a hard frost is expected and when 
                    soils are below 60 degrees F.</p>
